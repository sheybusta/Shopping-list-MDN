<!--

  you will write dev strategies in this module basically the same as in Incremental Developments
  the only difference is that there are now more types of tasks, for example:
    `type: css`
    `type: html`
    `type: logic`
    `type: handlers`
    `type: procedures`
    `type: listeners`
    `type: init`
    `type: data`
    ...

  a single user story may require a little bit of code in each of these folders
  it will take some time and practice to get used to this
